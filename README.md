# SolidWorks-SOLIDWORKS-TASK-SCHEDULER
This task involves using SOLIDWORKS Task Scheduler to automate the conversion of 3D models (part and assembly files) into 2D drawings (.SLDDRW), and subsequently export those drawings as PDF files. The process improves efficiency by batch-processing multiple files without manual intervention.
