# SolidWorks-SOLIDWORKS-TASK-SCHEDULER
This task involves using SOLIDWORKS Task Scheduler to automate the conversion of 3D models (part and assembly files) into 2D drawings (.SLDDRW), and subsequently export those drawings as PDF files. The process improves efficiency by batch-processing multiple files without manual intervention.
Steps:

Convert 3D Models to 2D Drawings:
Use Task Scheduler’s “Create Drawings” task to automatically generate 2D drawing files from selected 3D part (.SLDPRT) and assembly (.SLDASM) files using a predefined drawing template.

Export 2D Drawings to PDF:
Use the “Export Files” task in Task Scheduler to batch-convert the generated .SLDDRW files into PDF format for sharing and documentation.
